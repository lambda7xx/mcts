 Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat.

Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat. Let's break down the information given: Number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds: 20 Number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds: 3 * 20 = 60
Step 2: To determine the number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped in each time interval and then add up the results. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, 60 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the past 30 seconds means 60/2 = 30 kernels popped. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from residual heat, so 30/4 = 7.5 kernels popped.   To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we add up the number of kernels that popped in each time interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 30 + 7.5 = 207.5.   Therefore, Garrett has to eat 207.5 pieces of

Solution:Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat. Let's break down the information given: Number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds: 20 Number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds: 3 * 20 = 60
Step 2: Let's analyze the problem: In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, 60 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so 1/2 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.



 ============================== summary ============================== 

summary_prompt: 
 Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat.
